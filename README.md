# Osprey interpreter â€“ in Osprey!

The `ospi` project is an attempt at writing an Osprey interpreter, in Osprey. The module is pretty barebones at the moment (it doesn't even interpret Osprey code!), so there isn't really much more to say.

In addition to providing the command-line application `ospi`, this project contains the module `osprey.interpreter`, which exposes APIs for parsing and running simple Osprey code.

This is very much a work in progress. The application is not yet fully functional, but improvements are forthcoming.
